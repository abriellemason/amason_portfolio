                        I am a recent graduate of Michigan State University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Media and Information through the College of Communications, Arts and Sciences and minors in Graphic Design and Entrepreneurship and Innovation. I am extremely passionate and excited about understanding users and user needs to create products and spaces that make the user’s experience an experience they want to have again and again. I prefer the term “User Experiencer” rather than UX Researcher or UX Designer because user experience is not only about one or the other, but about the user first and foremost. Research and design go together to meet user needs. My dream jobs would be designing eco-friendly technologies, such as Tesla cars, reimagining traditional K-12 education, building unique and aesthetically pleasing night clubs, or creating simple and helpful health technologies, such as FitBit.

                        Collaborators: Nick Kopec, Dr. Andrew Mason
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Goal: The project was inspired by an LED equalizer I had seen once before and I decided to expand on that idea. The goals were to design and build a physical prototype display of 900 LEDs that could a) transcribe 30x30 pixel images, b) detect distance using ultrasonic sensors, c) detect sound using microphone sensors and display this information through the LEDs using Teensy 4.1. The board was designed to be placed up on the wall, similar to a painting, and be interactive to the audience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Roles: My roles included pitching the idea, designing the board, collecting the parts needed for this project, building the board, soldering LED strips to power, data and ground wires, drawing 30x30 pixel images, converting the images into a format compatible with Teensy 4.1, testing the lights many, many times, and writing a report on the project. I had many roles in this project that were very new to me and took time to understand how to carry out the role but in the end I was able to accomplish what I set out to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outcomes: The final results of the project were at least getting the lights to all display the same color, display an equalizer - a range of frequencies detected by microphone sensors - and a sequence of moving images, including a moonrise. I was hoping to write some algorithms for the lights to display, however, the soldering portion took much longer than expected. I ended up resoldering every single strip to data, power, and ground to shorten data lag between each strip. In the end, I did successfully create an interactive board of 900 LED lights.

                        What I Learned: I learned that no matter how much you plan, there are always obstacles and plans need to be flexible. What I learned from this project is how data is transferred, how electrical current works, and how to quickly learn programming and electrical engineering jargon on the spot. I acquired new skillsets in soldering and drawing out recognizable images in a few pixels, such as a firework.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Goal: The goal of this project was to take existing data, analyze it, and present the best findings to Mid-SURE. The research topic was focusing on people's willingness to give out an email that was not their own and maybe not knowing they could potentially be giving out someone else's email address and unintentionally spamming them with junk mail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Roles: My roles for this project included transcribing previously recorded interviews, anonymize the participants, create codes - short titles for reoccuring topics - in NVivo, analyzing the transcriptions on NVivo, organizing the findings in order of relevance and popularity, writing a report on my findings, designing a poster summarizing these findings, and finally presenting these findings via video format.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outcomes: The outcomes were somewhat all over the place. As you can see on my poster <a href ="midsure-poster.pdf">here</a>, there were a number of cases where it was merely a tie between doing something one way or the other. The findingers were particularly interesting, however, because there are many people who receive emails from someone or a company that the person receiving has no affiliation and we found that some people could be responsible for this occurrance. It was a very interesting find to say the least. You can watch my presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/EmXxoj7ed4s">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I Learned: Some key takeaways were that most people dislike being asked to give out an email address and at the same time people also feel compelled to provide an email address because they feel they are helping someone else in doing so. Some new skills I gained from this experience was how to create codes in NVivo, filtering out irrelevant findings, how to design a poster that resembles an email inbox, 
                        and how to record and create videos usign Camtasia.

                        Collaborators: Katie Oeschger
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Goal: The goal was to redesign the Department of Integrative Biology’s website in a way that would help students find the information they were looking for as well as provide informative information. Katie and I listened to students explain how they find information about MSU related stuff, such as event announcements or graduation requirements, and how they use the Department of Integrative Biology website. We were particularly interested in what the user pain points were primarily on the website and how they would like information displayed. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Roles: My roles for this project were reviewing Google Analytics of the website, researching about effective websites, writing up invitation emails for participants, writing questions for the interviews, interviewing participants, taking notes during the interviews, create participant profiles, draw user flows, transcribing the recorded interviews, breaking up participant's comments individually, organizing the information in a massive affinity diagram, and finally present our findings to a group of colleagues within the department.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outcomes: We spent the first month researching potential user needs and websites that successfully solve those user needs. The second month and a half was spent scheduling and conducting interviews and the remainder of the semester was spent organizing user pain points via affinity diagramming. The results were astounding. We found so much data about user pain points across many areas that were outside the scope of the website. We had enough data to share with the entire university, however, we chose to focus on redesigning the website. Unfortunately, I was unable to start a website prototype based on our findings but I was able to present my findings to the department and there has been other departments who have heard of Katie and my work and have started the process of fixing their websites as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I Learned: I learned that an hour and a half interview is way too long, around twenty participants is good for finding many similarities in the data, and that it is very easy to become mentally exhausted if you try to complete an affinity diagram in a few three-hour chuncks. Some new skills I have obtained include quick note-taking, drawing user profiles and user flows, finishing affinity diagrams, and how to transcribe interviews efficiently.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Goal: The goal of this project was to work with a local vendor and redesign a physical space on a budget. Michigan State's Computer Center was dark, small, and cramped and it was my personal goal to transform into an light and inviting place for people to come and have maintenance done on their laptops or shop for more technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Roles: With my team primarily focused on marketing and redesigning the Computer Center's website, I was responsible for redesigning the physical space. My roles included gathering space dimensions and blueprints, researching successful stores layouts, talking with the Computer Center team to find out their main goals with the space, discover the primary pain points, design a new space that meets the user's needs, and finally construct a miniature prototype of the building. I also had to present my prototype to the class and the Computer Center Team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outcomes: It was a success. The Computer Center Team loved my redesign of the space, including the lighter, brighter color scheme, reuse of materials, and the Apple store display theme I was going for. My prototype was actually scalable to the real space. Unfortunately, the Computer Center moved to a new location the following year but this project was designed for learning purposes only.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I Learned: I learned how critical color, lighting, and layout are in a space. I learned how to scale down the dimensions of a building and build my own prototype out of styrafoam, paint, and glue. Some new skills I acquired were how to work with a budget, and how to interact with the clients to gain more information about their wants and needs as a user.
