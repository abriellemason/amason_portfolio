                        I am an undergraduate at Michigan State University majoring in computer science through the school of engineering 
                        and minoring in graphic design. I am passionate about design and technology which lends to my interests in UX/UI 
                        and frontend development. During university, I further developed my skillset through my internship as a full-stack
                        software engineer at Target, my position as webmaster of MSU's <a href="http://msuwic.cse.msu.edu">ACM-W club</a>,

                        On Monday, state government leaders announced a 12-day extension to the current state order that prohibits in-person classes for colleges and universities and continues restrictions on other indoor social gatherings and group activities. It is unclear if the order will be extended again beyond Dec. 20; however, as we have from the outset, we will remain flexible and continue adapting our plans as necessary.

                        From the beginning of the pandemic, health and safety have been our guiding principles for the difficult but necessary actions to address COVID-19, maintain operations and support your continued success at MSU. Like this fall — and most of 2020 — things on campus will look different during the spring as we implement additional safety measures to help ensure a successful semester and best protect each of you and our broader community.
