                        I am a recent graduate of Michigan State University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Media and Information through the College of Communications, Arts and Sciences and minors in Graphic Design and Entrepreneurship and Innovation. I am extremely passionate and excited about understanding users and user needs to create products and spaces that make the user’s experience an experience they want to have again and again. I prefer the term “User Experiencer” rather than UX Researcher or UX Designer because user experience is not only about one or the other, but about the user first and foremost. Research and design go together to meet user needs. My dream jobs would be designing eco-friendly technologies, such as Tesla cars, reimagining traditional K-12 education, building unique and aesthetically pleasing night clubs, or creating simple and helpful health technologies, such as FitBit.

                        I am a highly creative problem solver, conceptual thinker, quick learner, and a radiator of positive vibes. I have experience in research, including interviewing, analyzing qualitative and quantitative data via NVivo, creating surveys via Qualtrics, affinity diagrams, and presenting my findings for Mid-SURE at Michigan State University. I also have experience in design - creating website mockups via Figma, drawing storyboards, building physical prototypes, drawing wireframes, and coding websites using HTML, CSS, and Java Script.
