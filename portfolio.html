                    Collaborators: Nick Kopec, Dr. Andrew Mason
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goal: The project was inspired by an LED equalizer I had seen once before and I decided to expand on that idea. The goals were to design and build a physical prototype display of 900 LEDs that could a) transcribe 30x30 pixel images, b) detect distance using ultrasonic sensors, c) detect sound using microphone sensors and display this information through the LEDs using Teensy 4.1. The board was designed to be placed up on the wall, similar to a painting, and be interactive to the audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roles: My roles included pitching the idea, designing the board, collecting the parts needed for this project, building the board, soldering LED strips to power, data and ground wires, drawing 30x30 pixel images, converting the images into a format compatible with Teensy 4.1, testing the lights many, many times, and writing a report on the project. I had many roles in this project that were very new to me and took time to understand how to carry out the role but in the end I was able to accomplish what I set out to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outcomes: The final results of the project were at least getting the lights to all display the same color, display an equalizer - a range of frequencies detected by microphone sensors - and a sequence of moving images, including a moonrise. I was hoping to write some algorithms for the lights to display, however, the soldering portion took much longer than expected. I ended up resoldering every single strip to data, power, and ground to shorten data lag between each strip. In the end, I did successfully create an interactive board of 900 LED lights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I Learned: I learned that no matter how much you plan, there are always obstacles and plans need to be flexible. What I learned from this project is how data is transferred, how electrical current works, and how to quickly learn programming and electrical engineering jargon on the spot. I acquired new skillsets in soldering and drawing out recognizable images in a few pixels, such as a firework.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Goal: The goal of this project was to take existing data, analyze it, and present the best findings to Mid-SURE. The research topic was focusing on people's willingness to give out an email that was not their own and maybe not knowing they could potentially be giving out someone else's email address and unintentionally spamming them with junk mail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roles: My roles for this project included transcribing previously recorded interviews, anonymize the participants, create codes - short titles for reoccuring topics - in NVivo, analyzing the transcriptions on NVivo, organizing the findings in order of relevance and popularity, writing a report on my findings, designing a poster summarizing these findings, and finally presenting these findings via video format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outcomes: The outcomes were somewhat all over the place. As you can see on my poster <a href ="midsure-poster.pdf">here</a>, there were a number of cases where it was merely a tie between doing something one way or the other. The findingers were particularly interesting, however, because there are many people who receive emails from someone or a company that the person receiving has no affiliation and we found that some people could be responsible for this occurrance. It was a very interesting find to say the least. You can watch my presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/EmXxoj7ed4s">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I Learned: Some key takeaways were that most people dislike being asked to give out an email address and at the same time people also feel compelled to provide an email address because they feel they are helping someone else in doing so. Some new skills I gained from this experience was how to create codes in NVivo, filtering out irrelevant findings, how to design a poster that resembles an email inbox, 
                    and how to record and create videos usign Camtasia.

                    The Challenge: What do students need to succeed?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    How can university units be assured that their ever-changing student body is receiving the resources that students actually need?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The department of Integrative Biology (IBIO) is home to more than 500 students majoring in Environmental Biology-Zoology, Integrative Biology, or Zoology. To help the greatest number of students, the department needed to become more strategic with its limited time and resources. The goal of this project was to understand what challenges department majors encounter and how to help these students achieve their academic and career goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I helped initiate, designed, and led this project for the Department of Integrative Biology at Michigan State University. This project was approved by Michigan State University's Institutional Review Board.

                <h3>
                    Design Process
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Discovery: </strong>What current resources exist? How do students use the website? Talking with real users. Device usage. Synthesizing interview data. Who makes up the student body? What is the student experience like?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ideation: </strong>Brainstorming solutions. Are competitors already implementing these ideas? Design recommendation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Design: </strong>Improving usability & findability. Preliminary design ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Conclusion: </strong>Broader implications. Limitations. Future work.

                <p>
                    <strong>Content audit + card sort</strong> - What current resources exist?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The undergraduate section of the Integrative Biology Website included 43 webpages, nine of which were listed under the main navigation. The older webpages were very text heavy. The information architecture and user interface needed improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the past year, only one new page was added, the Hands-On Opportunities Database. This database was developed based on real user needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To understand how to restructure the website's information architecture, we asked students to complete a card sort activity. Each student participant was handed a stack of index cards (i.e., each card represented a page in the undergraduate section of the website) and asked to sort the cards in a way that makes sense to him/her. The purpose of this activity was to understand their mental models of the website's information architecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Card sort data were analyzed by looking for themes and patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Web analytics</strong> - How do students use the website?
                </p>
                <p>
                    One way to understand how people were using the website was to review the Google Analytics data.  I evaluated the top-visited pages, landing pages, exit pages, bounce rates, and the content drill down. I found similar patterns in the data across multiple years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data suggested that users primarily accessed the website with their computer using Google. They used the search engine to go directly to the webpage of interest, circumventing the Homepage. These findings were later corroborated during student interviews. The top visited webpages are listed below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PUT THIS IN A LIST PLEASE: 1) undergrad degrees, 2) advising, 3)  overrides, 4) undergrad program, 5) hands-on opportunities database.

                    Date: April 2018 - May 2018

                <p>
                    Collaborators: MSU Computer Center Team
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goal: The goal of this project was to work with a local vendor and redesign a physical space on a budget. Michigan State's Computer Center was dark, small, and cramped and it was my personal goal to transform into an light and inviting place for people to come and have maintenance done on their laptops or shop for more technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roles: With my team primarily focused on marketing and redesigning the Computer Center's website, I was responsible for redesigning the physical space. My roles included gathering space dimensions and blueprints, researching successful stores layouts, talking with the Computer Center team to find out their main goals with the space, discover the primary pain points, design a new space that meets the user's needs, and finally construct a miniature prototype of the building. I also had to present my prototype to the class and the Computer Center Team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outcomes: It was a success. The Computer Center Team loved my redesign of the space, including the lighter, brighter color scheme, reuse of materials, and the Apple store display theme I was going for. My prototype was actually scalable to the real space. Unfortunately, the Computer Center moved to a new location the following year but this project was designed for learning purposes only.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I Learned: I learned how critical color, lighting, and layout are in a space. I learned how to scale down the dimensions of a building and build my own prototype out of styrafoam, paint, and glue. Some new skills I acquired were how to work with a budget, and how to interact with the clients to gain more information about their wants and needs as a user.
