                    I was brought up in the small town of Portland, MI where I attended a private K-12 school. It was there that I developed a passion for design, creativity, and uniqueness. Being with a class of only twenty students, I learned the values of collaboration, understanding, and empathy. I believe my education taught me how to be respectful and get along with everyone. When I was not doing schoolwork or working as an expeditor at the local bar and grill, you could find me playing guitar or piano, bowling a 190, throwing shotput or discus, Irish dancing, clearing brush, or trying something new, like making candles. I love learning new things and dabbling in a little bit of this and a little bit of that. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to travel Europe, Asia, and Central America and discover new cultures, new architecture, different landscapes, and of course delicious food. I have tried my hand at recreating some of the fantastic foreign dishes and am glad to say some turned out quite well.

                    After high school graduation in 2017, I moved to a dormitory at Michigan State University planning to become a Neurologist, someone who could study the anatomy of the brain and help people. After the first semester, I knew my talents lied in another direction and I made the change to Media and Information major focusing on Human-Centered Technology, giving me the opportunity to make technology that would both help people and give them something they enjoy using. I added on minors in Graphic Design and Entrepreneurship the following year and picked up more hobbies, including quilting, painting, and designing an interactive LED light display. I participated in two Startup Weekends as an aspiring entrepreneur and attended Startup Island, a personal and professional growth program during my time at Michigan State. I took on a research position at Behavior, Information, and Technologies Lab at Michigan State during my third year. I also had the opportunity to work with Michigan Virtual on their Customer Experience team in Lansing and am excited to continue working with them after graduation.

                    Over the last year, the pandemic has tested my mental, physical, and emotional strength, as I am sure most of you have had similar experiences. I have found peace in knowing that things can only get better from here. I have become a regular meditator and strong practicer in mindfulness, or being aware of the present moment, and showing gratitude for things that make life just a little more exciting, such as the decorative Christmas lights being put up in celebration of Christmas. I am thankful for this experience, as hard as that may seem, because it has taught me to be selfless, to appreciate the little things, accept that I may not be able to control everything, investing in self-care, and spending time with the important people in my life. I am hopeful we will see better days and have opportunities to travel someday soon.
